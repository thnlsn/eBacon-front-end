## Random Animal Fetcher

#### _This test is meant to show how you can fetch simple data from an API and manipulate it within the scope of a React app._

---

### How to get started:

- Follow this link: https://codesandbox.io/s/ebacon-react-animal-fetcher-gto72
- 'Fork' the template (top right-hand corner of screen)

---

##### There's some basic boilerplate setup already, and the criteria is as follows:

- Choose one of the provided API urls
- Every time you fetch, save the image to the screen without removing previous images
- Use semantic HTML to render all the images
- Add some basic style

---

### How to submit:

#### _Just send us a url link to your fork!_

---

### Bonus Point Considerations:

- Use both urls
- Make it look sexy
- Create some re-usable components
- Use `Sass` / `styledComponents` / or some other `CSS` tool

#### _This test is purposely open-ended, so feel free to try and impress us!_
