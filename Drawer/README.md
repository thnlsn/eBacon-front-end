## HTML/CSS Drawer Test

#### _This test is meant to show your a portion of your css layout skill set._

---

### How to get started:

- Follow this link: https://codesandbox.io/s/ebacon-htmlcss-drawer-test-nf1xn
- 'Fork' the template (top right-hand corner of screen)

---

##### There's some basic boilerplate setup already, and the criteria is as follows:

- The 'Show App Drawer Button' in the div.header, when clicked, should open a drawer in the div.app (please note, .app is .container's parent element).
- The 'Show Box Drawer Button' in the div.box, when clicked, should open a drawer in the div.box.
- You should be able to close the Drawer after it is visible.
- This is a test mostly about HTML/CSS layout. No need to over-engineer state, consider reusablitly, or other use cases.
- Add as many files/folders as you need.
